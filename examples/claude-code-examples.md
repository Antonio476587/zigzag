## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your request, the better the results
   - Instead of: *"Take a screenshot"*
   - Try: *"Take a PNG screenshot of my browser window"*

   - *"Take a screenshot, then analyze its UI elements for accessibility issues"*

3. **Time-based Operations**: Specify durations for monitoring tasks
   - *"Monitor performance for 2 minutes and give me a summary"*

4. **File Patterns**: Use specific patterns when watching files
   - *"Watch for changes in *.tsx files in my components directory"*

5. **Context Matters**: Provide context about what you're working on
   - *"I'm developing a React app, take a screenshot and analyze the component structure"*
